4.6 Season:   There shall be no closed season for any animal possessed for the purposes of hunting if in compliance with this rule.
4.7 License:   It is unlawful for any person to take an animal in a hunting facility unless in the possession of a valid and current Vermont hunting license.

22  1280 acres is equivalent to two square miles. Limiting the size to 1280 acres reduces the risk of interfering with populations of white-tailed deer, moose, bear and other species that depend on large areas of land during seasonal movement to fulfill their life requirements.

4.13 Feeding:   The feeding of ruminant protein to cervids is strictly prohibited. All facilities permitted under this rule are forbidden from feeding prohibited feed ingredients. The storage of prohibited feed in the same area as allowable feed is also prohibited. Feeding practices will be reviewed during inspections.
4.14 Animal Health:   Captive animals shall have sufficient food, water, and cover, as well as a variety of topographical areas and vegetation types that are not to become excessively degraded over time due to over-stocking of animals.

2.0 Purpose  The purpose of this regulation is to establish a Spring Conservation Order for harvesting of snow and Ross’ geese. The United Fish and Wildlife Service has issued a Conservation Order with the intent to decrease the population of light geese due to an overabundance of these species. Specifically, “[v]arious populations of light geese (greater and lesser snow geese and Ross’s geese) have undergone rapid growth during the past 30 years, and have become seriously injurious to their habitat, habitat important to other migratory birds, and agricultural interests. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service believes that several of these populations have exceeded the long term carrying capacity of their breeding and/or migration habitats and must be reduced.” The USFWS has set “forth regulations that authorize measures to increase harvest of certain populations of light geese.” This rule implements this directive.

4.1.1 Prohibited Fish Species Section:  Fish species for which importation into or possession within Vermont shall be prohibited except through a Commissioner’s Prohibited Fish Species Permit.  This section of the list primarily includes species not native to the State that are known to pose a threat to Vermont’s fish populations and/or aquatic ecosystems.
4.1.2 Restricted Fish Species Section:  This section of the list primarily includes native and certain naturalized fish species which although they may not require a Commissioner’s Prohibited Fish Species Permit as set out in 4.1.1 above, may be regulated through other department permits including but not limited to 10 V.S.A. § 4605</akn:p></akn:content></akn:subsection></akn:content></akn:subsection><akn:subsection eId="title-10A_chapter-2_section-121_subsec-b"><akn:num>(b)</akn:num><akn:content><akn:p>Importation of Fish; 10 V.S.A. § 5403, Protection of Endangered and Threatened Species; and 10 V.S.A.

6.1.2 A permit issued under this subsection shall include conditions that ensure the health and safety of Vermont’s fish population.
6.2 Restricted Fish Species Permits.   Fish in the Restricted Fish Species section do not require a Commissioner’s Prohibited Fish Species Permit.  However, as noted in paragraph 4.1.2 above, other Department permits may be required to import and/or possess fish listed in the Restricted Fish Species section.
7.0 Permit Applications.
7.1 Applications for Commissioner’s Prohibited Fish Species Permits shall be complete and submitted to the Department on an application form to be provided by the Department. For an application to be considered complete, it shall be legible, shall contain all information requested by the Department, shall contain no false statements, shall bear the applicant’s official signature and shall be accompanied by the required application fee.
